# Project Proposal: Analyzing the Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health
### Project Objective:
This project aims to analyze the impact of remote work on mental health using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data, we will work to uncover trends and relationships between remote work conditions, demographic factors, and mental health outcomes. The results will provide insights that can inform organizations on best practices for supporting employees' mental health in remote work environments.

## Dataset Overview:
Source: The dataset, Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv
### Content:

Remote work habits 

Mental health indicators 

Demographic details 

Other factors

## Machine Learning Approach:
### Supervised Learning:
Build a classification model (logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest) to predict mental health outcomes (stressed vs. not stressed) based on data.
### Unsupervised Learning:
Use clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering) to identify distinct groups of remote workers who share similar characteristics and outcomes

## Potential Impact:
The project will provide valuable insights into the relationship between remote work and mental health, offering practical recommendations for organizations and policymakers to support employees in a rapidly evolving work environment.
