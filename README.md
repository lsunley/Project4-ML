# Project Proposal: Analyzing the risk of credit card applicants
### Project Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the risk levels of credit card applicants based on their demographic, financial, and application-related features. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify applicants who are "risky" or "not risky" based on patterns from historical data.

### Target Variable:
"Risky"

"Not Risky"

## Machine Learning Approach:
### Supervised Learning:
Build a classification model (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and neural networks) to predict risk/no risk based on data.
### Unsupervised Learning:
Use clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering) to identify distinct groups of risky and non risky applicants who share similar characteristics and outcomes

## Potential Impact:
This project helps financial institutions improve decision-making for credit card approvals by accurately identifying high-risk applicants while minimizing defaults. The goal is to produce fair and data-driven decisions for applicants, increasing approval rates for low-risk individuals.
